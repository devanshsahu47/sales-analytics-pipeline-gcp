# üìà Automated Sales Data Pipeline & International Growth Dashboard (GCP)

This project showcases a fully automated, end-to-end data pipeline deployed on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. It ingests raw e-commerce sales data, processes it, stores it in a cloud data warehouse, and visualizes key business insights through an interactive **Looker Studio** dashboard focused on identifying international growth opportunities.

---

## üìå Objective

Build a **scalable, serverless data analytics system** that provides real-time insights into international sales performance.

Key goals:

- **Automated Data Ingestion**: Seamlessly load new sales data into the data warehouse.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncover trends and patterns in global sales.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Highlight international market performance through a dynamic dashboard.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The pipeline follows an **event-driven, serverless** architecture using GCP components:

| Stage          | Tool                    | Purpose                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Ingestion      | Google Cloud Storage    | Upload `.csv` files to trigger the pipeline             |
| Processing     | Cloud Run               | Serverless Python function processes & loads the data   |
| Storage        | BigQuery                | Scalable data warehouse for real-time SQL querying      |
| Visualization  | Looker Studio           | Dashboard connects to BigQuery for up-to-date insights  |

## üì¶ Dataset: E-Commerce Sales Data

**Filename**: `data.csv`  
A transactional dataset representing sales from an online retail company.

**Key Features**:

- `InvoiceNo`: Unique ID for each transaction
- `StockCode`, `Description`: Product identifiers and names
- `Quantity`: Number of units sold
- `InvoiceDate`: Timestamp of purchase
- `UnitPrice`: Price per item
- `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier
- `Country`: Location of purchase

## üîç Key Insights from EDA

- **Market Dominance**: The UK contributes ~85% of all sales, indicating high domestic reliance.
- **Order Cancellations**: Negative quantities signal frequent cancellations needing further attention.
- **Peak Sales Window**: 12 PM to 2 PM emerges as the busiest time for transactions.
- **Guest Checkouts**: ~25% of sales lack `CustomerID`, complicating customer retention analysis.

## üìä Dashboard Highlights: International Growth

The Looker Studio dashboard was developed to turn data into strategic direction for global expansion.

**Key Metrics & Findings**:

- **International Revenue Share**: 15.65% ‚Äì a measurable baseline for non-UK growth
- **Top Non-UK Markets**: Netherlands, Ireland (EIRE), Germany, France
- **Higher AOV Internationally**: 
  - Intl AOV: ‚Ç¨521  
  - UK AOV: ‚Ç¨426
- **Top Intl Products Differ**: Best-selling international products differ from domestic bestsellers, influencing region-specific campaigns.
